### The Problem
We have a whole bunch of data which is information about various different banknotes. For each measurement on a banknote, it is either classified as a counterfeit or not counterfeit (authentic). We have four different input values for each of the data points (variance, skewness, curtosis and entropy) and we have a label (0 indicates "not counterfeit" and 1 indicates "counterfeit")

We want to use supervised learning to predict or model some function that can take these four values(variance, skewness, curtosis and entropy) as input and predict what the output would be.
